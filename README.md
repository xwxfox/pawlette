# Pawlette

Pawlette is a Vite + React workspace for extracting color palettes from uploaded imagery, stress testing them in UI mockups, and exporting ready-to-use design tokens.

## Overview
- Drag an image into the uploader to run a fast extract plus a full palette analysis.
- Inspect dominant colors, harmony groupings, and generated gradients, then fine tune values with mixers, tint and shade builders, and per-channel adjustments.
- Preview the palette in several layout presets (landing, dashboard, cards, tables, forms, blog, ecommerce, analytics, profile) with customizable spacing, typography, glass effects, grain, and background styles.
- Verify accessibility using the WCAG checker, color-blind simulator, and automated suggestions before exporting.
- Export Shadcn/Tailwind themes, CSS variables, JSON/SCSS/JS/TS artifacts, Figma tokens, SVG previews, or shareable gradient bundles, and share palettes via URL, QR code, or ZIP archives.
- Persist palettes, theme tweaks, and gradient libraries in compressed localStorage and revisit them through the analysis history and collections view.

## Feature Highlights
- **Image ingestion and palette extraction**: streaming loader, quick preview colors, semantic role tagging, undo/redo history, and compressed persistence.
- **Palette tooling**: harmony generator, gradient editor with grain and blur controls, mesh/stripe previews, tint and shade batches, color mixing, and manual adjustment sliders.
- **Accessibility suite**: WCAG matrix, auto-generated contrast reports, keyboard shortcuts, and color blindness simulation with SVG filter matrices.
- **Preview workbench**: configurable Shadcn components, multiple layout modes, background styles (solid, gradient, mesh, fluid, glass, custom), dark/light toggles, and quick gradients for cards and buttons.
- **Export and sharing**: Tailwind config scaffolds, CSS + JSON exports, SCSS variables, JS/TS modules, Figma tokens, SVG previews, share links, QR generation, JSON imports/exports, and ZIP bundles for palette collections.
- **PWA support**: manifest, service worker registration, icon set, and offline-friendly caching.

## Tech Stack
- React 19 with the React Compiler plugin
- Vite 6 with Tailwind CSS 4 and shadcn/ui primitives
- Radix UI, Phosphor icons, Framer Motion, Sonner toasts
- Bun (default package manager), TypeScript strict null checks, ESLint 9

## Prerequisites
- Bun 1.1+ (or Node 18+ if you prefer npm/pnpm/yarn)

## Installation and Scripts
Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Type-safe build output:

```bash
bun run build
bun run preview
```

Lint the project:

```bash
bun run lint
```

If you are using npm or pnpm, run their equivalent `install`, `run dev`, `run build`, and `run lint` commands. Vite listens on port 5173 by default.

## Project Layout
- `src/App.tsx` – main workflow shell orchestrating uploads, routing between tools, keyboard shortcuts, and UI state.
- `src/components/*` – feature components such as palette generators, previews, accessibility tooling, sharing modals, and Radix-based UI primitives.
- `src/lib/*` – color math, analysis routines, theme builders, sharing/export helpers, and general utilities.
- `src/hooks/*` – localStorage compression, undo/redo history, and auto-collapse behavior.
- `src/styles` – theme tokens layered over Tailwind.
- `public` – PWA assets, icons, and service worker.

## Working in the App
1. Upload an image or load a shared palette link to create a `ColorAnalysis` record.
2. Refine palettes via Colors, Gradients, Palettes, Tools, Accessibility, and Analysis tabs; each tab persists settings in localStorage for fast iteration.
3. Switch to Preview to apply the palette to multiple UI mockups, adjust theme config (spacing, radius, shadows, gradients, grain), and test dark mode.
4. Export the theme or share it: choose CSS/JSON/SCSS/JS/TS, Tailwind config, Figma tokens, SVG previews, gradient bundles, QR codes, or palette collections.

## Accessibility and Shortcuts
- WCAG checker provides matrix, report, and suggestions plus downloadable markdown reports.
- Color blind simulator supports nine filter types via SVG matrices.
- Keyboard shortcuts cover upload navigation, undo/redo, saving to collections, exporting, sharing, copying colors, toggling dark mode, clearing analyses, help modal, and quick tab switching.

## Data Persistence and Sharing
- Color analyses, theme configurations, custom gradients, and palette collections persist in localStorage using the compressed storage hook.
- Shared palettes are encoded into the URL so anyone can load them without a backend.
- Collections can be exported/imported as JSON or bundled as ZIP archives with autogenerated README notes.

## Testing
No automated tests ship with the repository today. Run `bun run lint` before committing to catch common issues, and consider adding Vitest or Playwright coverage if you extend the project.
